# Launch Day Content - Ready to Post

## X/Twitter Thread (Post at 9 AM)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
AI assistants giving you 5 questions at once?

Analysis paralysis from dense responses?

I built a free command that transforms overwhelming AI output into digestible conversations.

Here's how it works (and why your brain needs it): 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
```
Yesterday Claude gave me this:

"Here are 5 questions about your architecture:
1. Is X blocking Y?
2. What's your deployment strategy?
3. Should we refactor Z?
4. Have you considered A?
5. What's your B coverage?

Also, here's my analysis... [3 more paragraphs]"

Me: 😰
```

**Tweet 3 (Why It Happens):**
```
The mismatch is simple:

AI optimizes for completeness.
Humans need processability.

AI can "think" about 10 things at once.
Your working memory? 4±1 chunks (Cowan, 2001).

When AI dumps 15 chunks → cognitive overload → decision paralysis.
```

**Tweet 4 (The Solution):**
```
So I built `/breakitdown` - a Claude Code command that chunks overwhelming responses using TodoWrite.

Instead of dumping everything at once, it presents:
→ One question at a time
→ One checkpoint at a time
→ Natural conversation flow
```

**Tweet 5 (How It Works):**
```
Technical approach:

1. AI detects complex pending response
2. Creates TodoWrite with sequential checkpoints
3. Presents ONLY first checkpoint
4. Waits for your answer
5. Marks complete, moves to next
6. Repeat until done

Simple. Effective. Respects your brain.
```

**Tweet 6 (Before/After Visual):**
```
BEFORE:
AI: [5 questions + 8 recommendations + 3 analyses]
You: 😵

AFTER:
AI: "First checkpoint: Question 1?"
You: "Answer"
AI: ✅ "Got it. Question 2?"
You: "Answer"
AI: ✅ "Perfect. Question 3?"

Conversation, not monologue.
```

**Tweet 7 (The Science):**
```
Why your brain loves this:

Working memory capacity = 4±1 chunks
Exceeding this → information loss + poor decisions

Sequential processing > parallel information dumps
Confirmation loops → better understanding

This isn't preference. It's cognitive architecture.
```

**Tweet 8 (Installation):**
```
It's free. Takes 2 minutes to add to Claude Code:

1. Download from GitHub
2. Copy to ~/.claude/commands/
3. Use /breakitdown in any conversation

That's it.

→ github.com/[username]/breakitdown-command
```

**Tweet 9 (Use Cases):**
```
Use it when AI gives you:

• Multiple questions (3+) at once
• Dense multi-section analyses
• Too many options to evaluate
• Complex planning decisions
• Overwhelming code reviews

Basically: when you feel cognitively overloaded.
```

**Tweet 10 (The Meta Moment):**
```
This tool came from 2 years of studying cognitive architecture for AI.

My background: MSc Cognitive Science → Self-taught AI Engineer

Old school hacker vibes: Build useful stuff. Give it away. Make tools better.

That's the ethos.
```

**Tweet 11 (CTA):**
```
Grab it here: [GitHub link]

It's MIT licensed - use it, modify it, share it.

If it helps, ⭐ star the repo and share it.

That's how we build better tools together.

Building in public. One tool at a time.
```

**Optional Tweet 12 (Video Hook - if you add demo video):**
```
Quick demo video showing it in action: [video link]

Watch how overwhelming responses transform into natural conversation. 30 seconds.
```

When AI Assistants Overwhelm: A Cognitive Science Solution

After 2 years building AI systems, I noticed a pattern:

AI assistants optimize for completeness. Humans need sequential processing.

The result? Analysis paralysis. Decision fatigue. Cognitive overload.

So I built a solution I'm giving away for free: the `/breakitdown` command.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE PROBLEM

AI responses often contain:
→ Multiple questions at once (5+)
→ Dense analyses with many sections (8+)
→ Too many options to evaluate (10+)
→ Complex recommendations requiring decisions

Your brain's reaction: 😵 Overwhelm.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE SCIENCE

Working memory capacity = 4±1 chunks (Cowan, 2001)

When AI exceeds this limit, we struggle to:
• Process information effectively
• Make quality decisions
• Retain what we've learned
• Respond productively

This isn't preference - it's neuroscience.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE SOLUTION

`/breakitdown` transforms AI monologues into conversations.

Instead of dumping everything at once:
✅ Chunks complex responses into checkpoints
✅ Presents one question/section at a time
✅ Waits for your response before continuing
✅ Creates natural conversation flow
✅ Respects cognitive limits

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW IT WORKS

Technical implementation:
1. AI detects complexity in pending response
2. Creates sequential checkpoints using TodoWrite
3. Presents first checkpoint only
4. User responds
5. Marks complete, moves to next
6. Repeats until conversation complete

Simple. Effective. Science-based.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY IT MATTERS

As AI becomes more capable, the human-AI interface becomes critical.

We can't just make AI smarter—we need to make the interaction match how brains actually work.

This is what 10 years of cognitive science research looks like applied to AI UX.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IT'S FREE. IT'S OPEN SOURCE.

GitHub: [link]
License: MIT
Platform: Claude Code (adapters for others welcome)

If you work with AI assistants and experience cognitive overload, try it.

If it helps, share it.

BACKGROUND

My journey: Cognitive Scientist → AI Engineer
• MSc Cognitive Science (working memory & attention research)
• 2 years self-taught AI development
• Building voice-first cognitive systems
• Sharing everything I learn

Old school hacker ethos: Build useful tools. Give them away.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Building in public. One tool at a time.

## Follow-Up Posts Schedule

### Day 2 (Traction Tweet)
```
`/breakitdown` update:

24 hours in:
• [X] GitHub stars
• [X] downloads
• [X] DMs saying "this is exactly what I needed"

One user adapted it for their team's documentation review process.

This is why we build in public. Real problems, real solutions, real impact.

[GitHub link]
```

### Day 3 (Usage Tip)
```
Quick `/breakitdown` tip:

Use it when you feel that moment of "wait, there's too much here."

Your cognitive load is the best indicator.

Perfect for:
• Complex debugging
• Architecture planning
• Code reviews
• Feature scoping
• Learning new concepts

Trust your brain. It knows.
```

### Day 5 (Why I Built This)
```
Why I built `/breakitdown`:

In my MSc research, I studied working memory limits in humans.

In my AI work, I saw those limits violated constantly by AI responses.

The solution wasn't making AI simpler.

It was making the interaction sequential.

Cognitive science + AI UX = tools that actually help.
```

### Day 7 (Week 1 Results)
```
`/breakitdown` - Week 1:

The numbers:
• [X] stars
• [X] forks
• [X] issues/discussions

The impact:
• Adapted for 3 different AI assistants
• Featured in [community/newsletter if applicable]
• Real users solving real problems

Best part: The community contributions. This is how open source works.

Week 2 goal: Publish the deep-dive blog post on the cognitive science behind it.
```
