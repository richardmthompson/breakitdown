## AI Response (Without `/breakitdown`)

Here's my analysis of your day structure:

**Time Breakdown:**
- Deep work: 4 hours (25%)
- Meetings: 3 hours (19%)
- Email/Slack: 2 hours (13%)
- Context switching: 1.5 hours (9%)
- Lunch/breaks: 1 hour (6%)
- Admin tasks: 1.5 hours (9%)
- Unaccounted: 3 hours (19%)

**Analysis Section 1: Deep Work Patterns**
Your deep work blocks are fragmented. You have three 80-minute sessions instead of focused 2-hour blocks. Research shows deep work requires 23 minutes to reach flow state (Gloria Mark, 2008), so you're losing ~45 minutes daily to ramp-up time. Additionally, your deep work sessions occur at suboptimal times - 2 PM and 4 PM when cognitive performance typically declines.

**Analysis Section 2: Meeting Distribution**
Your meetings cluster in the morning (9 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM), fragmenting your best cognitive hours. This creates a "swiss cheese" effect on your schedule where you can't achieve meaningful work before lunch.

**Analysis Section 3: Context Switching Costs**
You're switching contexts 14 times per day. At 15 minutes per switch (Sophie Leroy, 2009 - attention residue), you're losing 3.5 hours of productive time weekly.

**Questions:**
1. Is the context engineering framework currently blocking the VoxPlan release?
2. What's the 0.5hr job search block - is this CV updates or active applications?
3. Should we move deep work blocks to morning hours (6-9 AM)?
4. Can any of these meetings be async updates instead?
5. What's causing the 3 hours of unaccounted time - is this recovery or waste?

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing time-blocking with 90-minute deep work sessions
- Maybe batch all meetings to Tuesday/Thursday afternoons
- You could also try the Pomodoro technique for better focus tracking
- Eliminate context switches by turning off notifications during deep work
- Move creative work to morning hours when cortisol is highest
- Consider whether job search activities should be scheduled or opportunistic
- Track unaccounted time for one week to identify patterns
- Implement a "no-meeting Wednesday" policy for your team

**Also worth considering:**
Your current structure suggests you're optimizing for responsiveness over deep work. This might be appropriate if you're in a leadership role, but it's expensive for individual contributor work. The question is: what's your actual role requirement?

## User Reaction
😵 **Cognitive overload**
- Where do I even start?
- Which question should I answer first?
- Do I need to address all the recommendations?
- I've already forgotten what was in Analysis Section 1
- Too much to process at once

## The Problem
- **8 distinct analyses** presented simultaneously
- **5 questions** asked at once
- **8 recommendations** without prioritization
- **Working memory exceeded**: ~15+ chunks vs. 4±1 capacity
- **Decision paralysis**: No clear next step
