## Demo Video Suggestions

You mentioned filming a demo! Here's what would work well:

**30-Second Format:**
1. Show overwhelming AI response (3-5 seconds)
2. "This is cognitive overload" (2 seconds)
3. Type `/breakitdown` (2 seconds)
4. Show chunked conversation flow (15 seconds)
5. "That's better" + GitHub link (5 seconds)

**2-Minute Format:**
1. Hook: "AI giving you too much at once?" (5 sec)
2. Show the problem - dense AI response (15 sec)
3. Explain the science - working memory limits (20 sec)
4. Demonstrate `/breakitdown` in action (60 sec)
5. Results + CTA (20 sec)

**Post video as:**
- Tweet 12 in thread (optional)
- Separate standalone tweet later in day
- LinkedIn video post tomorrow

## Success Metrics (Track These)

**Day 1:**

## You've Got This! 🚀

Everything is prepped. Content is solid. Strategy is clear.

Tomorrow morning:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Launch on X at 9 AM
3. Engage intensively
4. Have fun building in public!

This is going to be great. The tool solves a real problem, the content demonstrates real expertise, and you're sharing it authentically.

**That's the formula for building in public success.**
